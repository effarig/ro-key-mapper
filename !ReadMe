KeyMapper
=========

Requirements
------------
- RISC OS 3.5 or later.
- 26/32 bit compatible.

Introduction
------------
KeyMapper is a small module which allows the redefinition of which keys
produce which key codes within RISC OS. Mouse buttons are also treated as
keys in RISC OS, so this module can be used, say, to swap SELECT and ADJUST
over. See exaples, below.

All keys are represented using RISC OS 'internal key numbers', which can be
found in the PRMs or the OS StrongHelp manual.

Command Syntax
--------------
  | Command               | Description                                 |
  | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | `*KeyMap <from> <to>` | Maps key number <from> to <to>.             |
  | `*KeyMap <from>`      | Show current mapping for key number <from>. |
  | `*KeyMap`             | Show all redefined key numbers.             |
  | `*KeyMapReset`        | Reset all redefined key numbers.            |

Examples
--------
To swap mouse SELECT and ADJUST buttons:
    *KeyMap 112 114
    *KeyMap 114 112

These mappings alone can be reset using:
    *KeyMap 112 112
    *MeyMap 114 114
