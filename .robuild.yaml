# Example .robuild.yml file

# Source is optional (NYI), and should be a URL to source the content from

# Defines a list of jobs which will be performed.
# Only 1 job will currently be executed.
jobs:
  build:
    # Env defines system variables which will be used within the environment.
    # Multiple variables may be assigned.
    env:
      "Sys$Environment": ROBuild
      "BUILD32": 1

    # Directory to change to before running script
    #dir: <working directory>

    # Commands which should be executed to perform the build.
    # The build will terminate if any command returns a non-0 return code or an error.
    script:
      # Zip isn't present in the environment, but MiniZip is.
      # But minizip doesn't take an '-r' switch, so we'll skip it.
      # And we don't want a directory creating at the top level so we use -J.
      - Set Alias$Zip MiniZip %0 -v %*2
      - cdir hdr
      - rename include/hdr hdr.include
      - amu -f Makefile dist
      # Although we create a zip archive inside the makefile, the build service
      # takes the release directory and archives it itself.
      # (limitation of the build service - only directories can be artifacted)

    # Outputs from the build are defined in artifacts
    # These are a list of artifacts to report directories or files.
    # Only a single item is currently supported.
    artifacts:
      # Each element of the artifacts should have a path key, which gives the file or
      # directory to return.
      - path: Dist
